## FIGHTING MONGEESE LAUNCH DOGAGATCHI+, CROWDS REJOICE

NEW ORLEANS, LA - On Monday, November 13th, 2023 the public caught their first glimpse of Dogagatchi+, the latest hotly anticipated title from the extremely talented development team, Fighting Mongeese. The game was revealed during a shared session between the Junior and Senior classes of Operation Spark.

Geremy Fisher, a member of Fighting Mongeese, gushed about the project: "Our team worked hard to deliver Dogagatchi+ and we're extremely proud of the results. We fully expect this technology to disrupt the digital pets ecosystem."

Dogagatchi+ allows players to collect and care for canine avatars called Dogagatchis. Players earn coins by identifying the breeds of pictured dogs during a gameplay mode called 'Pooch Picker'; the coins earned may be spent to acquire and take care of Dogagatchis in the user's 'Kennel'. Users may elect to shower their Dogagatchis with sweetmeats and snacks purchased from the app's 'Bone Appétit Café'.

"I've become very attached to my Dogagatchis," said addicted beta tester and Fighting Mongeese member, Sydney Andre.

The game's hyper-realism sets it apart from second-class imitations. A user's Dogagatchis must be regularly 'fed' and 'walked'. Dogs that grow too hungry or discontent will run away, leaving the user in a state of bottomless shame. 

"It's basically Bitcoin for Tamagatchis," said Fighting Mongeese member and spokesperson, James Sheppard, with a devilish smile.

Initial reactions to the launch were generally positive.

"Oh, this is like a full app," said unabashed fanboy and Fighting Mongeese member, Evan Perry. 

Representatives of Japanese conglomerate Bandai Namco, which developed the esteemed Tamagatchi brand of digital pets, have petitioned international courts to block further monetization of Dogagatchi+ by Fighting Mongeese due to alleged copyright infringement. 

"We're looking forward to our day in court," said Bandai Namco representative and Fighting Mongeese member, AJ Bell.
